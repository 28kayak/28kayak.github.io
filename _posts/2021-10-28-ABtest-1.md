# AB test 
* An expriment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random.
* statistical anlysis is used to determine which variation perform better for a give conversion goal and whether the improvment is `statistically significant`.
* conversion (the process of changing) goals can be around clicks, subscriptions, purchases etc.
* the current page, or the current business as usual scenario is also reffered to as the `Control`.
    * the new Page / the new business is often reffered to as `Test`.

## When to use AB test
1. Test the differing impacts of alternate campaifn / web page desgins or approaches 
2. Test one element on the page.

# Why are statistic important to AB test?
* AB test is an example of statistical hypothesis testing.

## Concept of Sampling Error
### Regression Towards the Mean 
* regression toward the mean is "the phenomenon that if a variable is extream on its first measurement, it will tends to be closer to the average on its 2nd measurement" and vice vase. 

* As we continue increasing sample size, and the length of observation, the mean of our observations will get closer and closer to true mean population. 

## Confidence Interval 
### Example
* Original Page 
```
# of visitors = 1'000
# of conversions = 100

Conversion Rate of Page =  100/1000
= 10%
```
10% simply the mean of our sample. 
we want to know `the mean of population`

## What affect the width of the confidence intervals 
1. variation in population 
2. size of sample 
3. confidence level 

Effect of variation = population with low variation.
